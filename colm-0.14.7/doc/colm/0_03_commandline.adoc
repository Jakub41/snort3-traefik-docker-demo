Commandline
===========

Let's start colm with the '--help' command line argument.

----
colm --help
----

NOTE: This reflects the development version 0.13.0.4;


```usage: colm [options] file
general:
   -h, -H, -?, --help   print this usage and exit
   -v --version         print version information and exit
   -o <file>            write output to <file>
   -c                   compile only (don't produce binary)
   -e <file>            write C++ export header to <file>
   -x <file>            write C++ export code to <file>
   -m <file>            write C++ commit code to <file>
   -a <file>            additional code file to include in output program
```

This reveals us some more insights: it reads a 'colm' file and creates a object file with eventually cpp/h/x code.
