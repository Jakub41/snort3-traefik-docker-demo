/**
 * \class AvlBasic
 * \brief AVL Tree in which the entire element structure is the key.
 *
 * AvlBasic is an AVL tree that does not distinguish between the element that
 * it contains and the key. The entire element structure is the key that is
 * used to compare the relative ordering of elements. This is similar to the
 * BstSet structure.
 *
 * AvlBasic does not assume ownership of elements in the tree. Items must be
 * explicitly de-allocated.
