/**
 * \class AvliSet
 * \brief Linked Key-only oriented tree.
 *
 * AvliSet stores only keys in elements that are managed by the tree. AvliSet
 * requires that a Key type and a class containing a compare() routine
 * for Key be given. Items are inserted with just a key value.
 *
 * AvliSet assumes all elements in the tree are allocated on the heap and are
 * to be managed by the tree. This means that the class destructor will delete
 * the contents of the tree. A deep copy will cause existing elements to be
 * deleted first.
